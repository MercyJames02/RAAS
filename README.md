Decryption Tool

üîí Overview

This Python-based decryption tool helps users decrypt files encrypted with AES encryption (PyCrypto or PyAES). It supports CBC and CTR modes and provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy operation.

üìå Features

Supports PyCrypto (CBC mode) and PyAES (CTR mode) decryption.

Allows users to choose encryption type before decrypting.

Prompts for decryption key and directory selection.

Decrypts files with a .DEMON extension.

Removes ransom notes (README.txt) if present.

Provides warnings to avoid accidental corruption of files.

üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Requirements

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3 installed and install required libraries using:

pip install pyaes pycryptodome pymsgbox tkinter

2Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Script

Run the script using:

python decryptor.py

üöÄ Usage

Select encryption type (PyCrypto, PyAES, or Ghost mode).

Enter the decryption key when prompted.

Choose the directory containing encrypted files.

The tool will decrypt all .DEMON files in the directory.

It will remove ransom notes (README.txt) if found.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

Use the correct decryption key; otherwise, files may become corrupted.

Ghost mode only renames files instead of decrypting them.

Backup encrypted files before running the tool to prevent accidental loss.
